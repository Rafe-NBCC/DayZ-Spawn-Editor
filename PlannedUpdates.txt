**Higher Priority**

1. Change setters of ComplexChild and SimpleChild Lists to be null if empty. Will hopefully
   place nothing on .json if empty. 

1. Save all data to external file in main and edit form so loadouts can be saved.


*Lower Priority*

1. Create parralell arrays for all item names, display in game item name to user.

2. Restrict combo box selection in weapon slots to only allow attachments on guns that are accepted.

3. Allow users to upload pre built .json file and have it population UI, and display any errors in population.


*Ongoing*

1. Update arrays with new items added.
