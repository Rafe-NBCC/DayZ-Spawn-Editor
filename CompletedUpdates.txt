				   **Code**

   while transiting between forms.

				**v1.0.0-Release**

				  **Changelog**
1. Added selection for custom pistols in the plate carrier holster slot.
2. Combo boxes are now in alphabetical order.


				  **BugFixes**
1. Trimmed whitespace from MilitaryBelt .txt file, potentially was causing bugs with presets.
2. Fixed U-70 name in .txt file.


				   **Code**
1. Presets now reference SelectedItem string instead of selected index, more reliable when adding items that 
presets get selected. Also sorted all cmbs, expect mags because currently they are in a parrallel array with 
code names.
2. Changed combo boxes to reference SelectedItems instead of SelectedIndex, allows for more accurate targeting, 
and the ability to sort cmbs alphabetically. 
3. When external .txt files are read in Trim() function was added to remove any possible whitespace.
4. Parrallel arrays for mags deleted, now one array holds mags in format of "M14_20Rnd" and during 
   Object creation string "Mag_" is added.
5. Preset loadout selection changed to reference selected item instead of selected index.
6. Mag cbos Sorted in alphabetical order.
